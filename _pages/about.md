I am a Research Scientist in [Joint Quantum Institute](https://jqi.umd.edu/) at [University of Maryland at College Park](https://www.umd.edu/). I am currently on the 2022-2023 academic job market, looking for faculty openings in AMO/Quantum Information Science/Nonlinear Optics(Physics/EE/ECE). Please feel free to contact me if you are interested.

# Research
Quantum control and coherence in AMO physics enable a series of studies of non-traditional areas. Examples include the study of gravitational physics using a matter-wave interferometer, entanglement-induced topological phenomena, and the realization of dissipative Kerr solitons in warm atomic vapor. 

## Matter-wave interferometer on an atom chip, a platform for quantum optics and gravity studies

An atom chip with a miniaturized structure offers a high level of spatial and temporal control of local fields, 
making it an ideal tool for controlling the forces on the Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). Utilizing pulsed magnetic field gradients generated by currents in 
an atom chip wire and radio-frequency Rabi transitions between Zeeman sublevels (Fig1.A), I have realized a field gradient beam splitter (FGBS) for cold atoms, 
which allows the splitting of atoms into a continuous wide range of different momentum states but also enables the recombining of the split atoms. This process 
is highly coherent by observing interference fringes and the phase diagrams.   With the prepared spatial quantum superposition, I used an additional Rabi transition 
to prepare the two-level clock states and a weak magnetic gradient to induce the relative clock rotation to study a relative time lag as which-path information in 
clock interferometry [[Science2015](https://zhifanzhou.com/publications/Magalit2015)]. Furthermore, I proposed and demonstrated a new quantum complementarity relation for clocks in the context of general relativity. [2]. 
 
The FGBS population fringe can be realized by reversing the splitting and stopping magnetic gradients in a time-reversed manner (Fig.1B) to recombine the atomic 
wavepackets in position and momentum space. The separation of the wavepackets can be larger than the size of each wavepacket, thus realizing a complete Stern-Gerlach 
interferometer, a regime where theoreticians in quantum gravity will feel excited about [4].

## An experimental test of the geodesic rule proposition
for the noncyclic geometric phase
<img src="/images/JumpFigure.png" title="mapf demo" style="float:right;width:300pt;padding-left:10px;" />
The geometric phase due to the evolution of the Hamiltonian is a central concept in quantum physics and may become advantageous for quantum technology. In noncyclic evolutions, a proposition relates the geometric phase to the area bounded by the phase-space trajectory and the shortest geodesic connecting its end points. The experimental demonstration of this geodesic rule proposition in different systems is of great interest, especially
due to the potential use in quantum technology. Here, we report a previously unshown experimental confirmation of the geodesic rule for a noncyclic geometric phase by means of a spatial SU(2) matter-wave interferometer, demonstrating, with high precision, the predicted phase sign change and ÔÅ∞ jumps. We show the connection
between our results and the Pancharatnam phase. Last, we point out that the geodesic rule may be applied to
obtain the red shift in general relativity, enabling a new quantum tool to measure gravity.

## Dissipative Kerr solitons in a warm atomic vapor system
<img src="/images/DKS.png" title="mapf demo" style="float:right;width:300pt;padding-left:10px;" />
Light-atom interactions in gaseous atoms exhibit strong and tunable nonlinearity and dispersion, enabling exotic physics to be realized. Dissipative Kerr solitons (DKSs) 
are self-localized photonic structures resulting from the double balance of dispersion by nonlinearity and loss by parametric gain, which are typically 
realized in solid-state systems. In Fig.3, I present DKSs based on a four-wave mixing process in hot rubidium atoms . The solitons are 
tunable with pump detuning and laser power and exhibit Turing rolls, platicons, and dark-soliton formation. The realization of DKSs in the atomic systems 
will facilitate the fundamental study of nonlinear optics such as the direct observation of the dynamics in the temporal domain and the precise control such as soliton collisions. As quantum light sources 
are readily available with a four-wave mixing process in hot rubidium atoms, it is interesting to explore the quantum properties of DKSs and the 
relationship with the quantum dynamics of photons.
