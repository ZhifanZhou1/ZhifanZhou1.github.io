I am a Research Scientist in [Joint Quantum Institute](https://jqi.umd.edu/) at [University of Maryland at College Park](https://www.umd.edu/). 

# Research
Quantum control and coherence in AMO physics are enabling a series of studies of non-traditional areas. Examples include the study of gravitational physics, 
quantum simulation of condensed matter systems, and the realization of dissipative Kerr solitons in warm atomic vapor. 

## Matter-wave interferometer on an atom chip, a platform for quantum optics and gravity studies

An atom chip with a miniaturized structure offers a high level of spatial and temporal control of local fields, 
making it an ideal tool for controlling the forces on the Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). Utilizing pulsed magnetic field gradients generated by currents in 
an atom chip wire and radio-frequency Rabi transitions between Zeeman sublevels (Fig1.A), I have realized a field gradient beam splitter (FGBS) for cold atoms, 
which allows the splitting of atoms into a continuous wide range of different momentum states but also enables the recombining of the split atoms. This process 
is highly coherent by observing interference fringes and the phase diagrams.   With the prepared spatial quantum superposition, I used an additional Rabi transition 
to prepare the two-level clock states and a weak magnetic gradient to induce the relative clock rotation to study a relative time lag as which-path information in 
clock interferometry [1]. Furthermore, I proposed and demonstrated a new quantum complementarity relation for clocks in the context of general relativity. 
The gravitational redshift was emulated by a precisely controlled magnetic gradient [2]. 

With clock interferometry, I have experimentally demonstrated the predicted phase sign change and ùûπ jumps based on the geodesic rule [3]. The two hindering points of 
making it a new quantum tool to measure gravity are: the gravitational redshift signal is typically weaker than the required ùûπ, and the phase jump corresponds to the 
minimal visibility. For the research I want to perform, I will use optical pumping to have a ùûπ offset to overcome the first obstacle and to use the modulation techniques 
to overcome the second obstacle, similar to what is done in the Pound-Drever-Hall technique. This phase rigidity and jump may furthermore induce the quantization of 
atomic momentum states (see Sec.3).
 
The FGBS population fringe can also be realized by reversing the splitting and stopping magnetic gradients in a time-reversed manner (Fig.1B) to recombine the atomic 
wavepackets in position and momentum space. The separation of the wavepackets can be larger than the size of each wavepacket, thus realizing a complete Stern-Gerlach 
interferometer, a regime where theoreticians in quantum gravity will feel excited about [4]. I plan to use a varied quantum optics technique, spatial dynamical decoupling, 
to enlarge the wave-packets separation further. The real test of quantum gravity would require a macroscopic object like an NV-center in a crystal. However, the experiment 
with an atom chip will let us know the sensitivity limit of spatial separation of a complete Stern-Gerlach interferometer.

## Quantized momentum transfer with on-chip ultracold bosonic atoms

I have experimentally investigated the relation between interferometric periodicity and momentum transfer (see also [6]) in a Stern-Gerlach matter-wave interferometer on 
an atom chip system (see sec.1). In Fig.3, I present the spatial frequency of the fringe to be constant with the varied magnetic fields and abrupt downward 
jumps scaling as 1/N for specific magnetic fields, where N is an integer number. The connection between this quantization and the quantized geometric phase 
has been illustrated. I plan to probe the dynamical origin of this phenomenon and its relation with Berry curvature and Chern number. I believe this 
versatile free-space simulator on an atom chip will give a deeper understanding of the fundamentals of quantum transport, topology, and symmetry.

## Dissipative Kerr solitons in a warm atomic vapor system
<img src="/images/DKS.png" title="mapf demo" style="float:right;width:200pt;padding-left:10px;" />
Light-atom interactions in gaseous atoms exhibit strong and tunable nonlinearity and dispersion, enabling exotic physics to be realized. Dissipative Kerr solitons (DKSs) 
are self-localized photonic structures resulting from the double balance of dispersion by nonlinearity and loss by parametric gain, which are typically 
realized in solid-state systems. In Fig.4, I present DKSs based on a four-wave mixing process in hot rubidium atoms (see also [7]). The solitons are 
tunable with pump detuning and laser power and exhibit Turing rolls, platicons, and dark-soliton formation. The realization of DKSs in the atomic systems 
will facilitate the direct observation of the dynamics in the temporal domain and the precise control such as soliton collisions. As quantum light sources 
are readily available with a four-wave mixing process in hot rubidium atoms, it is interesting to explore the quantum properties of DKSs and the 
relationship with the quantum dynamics of photons.
